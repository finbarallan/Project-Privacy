**Last Updated:** 21st September 2025  
**Developer:** Finbar  
**Contact:** contact@optophoto.com

## Overview

Opto is designed with privacy at its core. I believe your photos should remain yours. This policy explains how Opto handles your information in this photo organization app.

## Information We Collect

### Photo Access
- **Purpose:** Opto accesses your photo library solely to display photos for organization purposes
- **Processing:** All photo processing happens locally on your device
- **Storage:** No photos are uploaded, transmitted, or stored on external servers

### App Store Analytics & Distribution
Opto is distributed through Apple's App Store and is subject to Apple's privacy practices:

- **App Store Analytics:** Apple may collect aggregated, anonymous usage data about app downloads and usage
- **Apple's Privacy Policy:** Your relationship with Apple and their data practices are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy
- **Device Information:** Apple may collect basic device and performance information as part of iOS operation

Opto may also collect analytics data to improve the app:
- **Crash Reports:** Anonymous crash data to fix bugs and improve stability
- **Feature Usage:** Aggregated data about which features are used most often
- **Performance Metrics:** App load times, response times, and performance data
- **General Usage Patterns:** How users navigate through the app (aggregated only)

All analytics data Opto collects is anonymous, aggregated, and cannot be linked to individual users.

### What We DON'T Collect
- Your photos or photo content
- Personal information or contact details
- Location data or photo metadata
- Individual user behavior or preferences

## How We Use Your Information

### Current Usage
- Photos are accessed only for display and organization within the app
- All photo operations (delete, favorite, organize) happen directly in your Photos library
- No photo data is uploaded, transmitted, or stored on external servers
- App preferences are stored locally using iOS standard mechanisms

### Future Analytics Usage
- Improve app performance and stability
- Understand general usage patterns to enhance features
- Monitor app crashes to fix bugs
- All analytics data is anonymous and aggregated only

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only
- All your photos and app data remain on your device
- Opto operates no servers that store user data
- Your data is protected by iOS built-in security and encryption
- App preferences are stored locally until you delete the app or reset your device
- Deleting the app removes all associated local data permanently

### Future Premium Features
- Any future premium features will maintain the same privacy standards
- Sharing features (if implemented) will use iOS native sharing mechanisms
- No data will be stored on external servers even with premium features

## Third-Party Services

### Current State
Opto operates completely offline with no third-party integrations.

### Future Integrations
- **App Store Analytics:** Anonymous, aggregated data only (managed by Apple)
- **Potential advertising networks:** If implemented, will be clearly disclosed
- All future integrations will maintain strict privacy standards
- Users will be notified of any significant privacy policy changes

## Your Rights and Choices

You have complete control over your data:

- **Photo Access:** You can revoke photo library access anytime in iOS Settings
- **Analytics:** When implemented, App Store Analytics can be disabled in iOS Settings  
- **Data Deletion:** Uninstalling the app removes all local data
- **Future Opt-outs:** Any future data collection will include clear opt-out mechanisms

### EU Users (GDPR)
For users in the European Union: You have additional rights under GDPR, though Opto collects minimal data. Contact me for any data-related requests.

## Children's Privacy

Opto does not knowingly collect any personal information from users. The app is designed to work entirely with your existing photo library without collecting personal data.

Parents should supervise their children's use of any app that accesses the photo library.

## International Users

Opto is available worldwide through the App Store. Since all data processing happens locally on your device, your data never leaves your region unless you explicitly share content using iOS sharing features.

**For EU users:** Opto complies with GDPR principles of data minimization and privacy by design.

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy to reflect:
- New features or functionality
- Legal or regulatory requirements  
- Improvements to Opto's privacy practices

### Notification of Changes
Significant changes will be communicated through:
- App Store update descriptions
- In-app notifications
- Updated policy date at the top of this document

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
