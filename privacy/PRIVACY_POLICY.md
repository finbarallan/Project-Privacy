## Overview
This policy explains how your information is handled by Opto. The application requires access to your photo library to help you review its contents and delete images on your behalf. This process happens entirely on-device to ensure you are the only one who can see your photos.

### App Store Analytics & Distribution
Opto is distributed through Apple's App Store and is subject to Apple's privacy practices:
- **App Store Analytics:** Apple may collect aggregated, anonymous usage data about app downloads and usage  
- **Apple's Privacy Policy:** Your relationship with Apple and their data practices are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy

- **Crash Reports:** Anonymous crash data to fix bugs and improve stability  
- **Feature Usage:** Aggregated data about which features are used most often  
- **Performance Metrics:** App load times, response times, and performance data

### What Data Opto Accesses
- Photos are accessed only for display and organisation within the app

### Children's Privacy
Opto does not collect any personal information from users of any age. The app is designed to work entirely with your existing photo library without collecting personal data.
